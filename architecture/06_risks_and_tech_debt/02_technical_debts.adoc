|===
|ID |Severity |Description |Remediation |Target

|[[TD1]]TD1
|High
|Hedera operator credentials stored in environment variables rather than secure vault
|Migrate to HashiCorp Vault or cloud KMS for all sensitive credentials
|Sprint 3

|[[TD2]]TD2
|Medium
|Limited automated test coverage for Hedera integration layer
|Add comprehensive integration tests using Hedera Testnet; mock SDK for unit tests
|Sprint 4

|[[TD3]]TD3
|Medium
|Points calculation rules hardcoded in service; no admin interface for rule management
|Implement rule engine with database-driven configuration; add admin UI for rule management
|Phase 2

|[[TD4]]TD4
|Low
|Batch processing does not support partial failure recovery from exact failure point
|Implement fine-grained checkpointing; store progress per client; resume from exact failure point
|Sprint 5

|[[TD5]]TD5
|Medium
|No rate limiting on internal service-to-service communication
|Implement service mesh with rate limiting; add circuit breakers between services
|Sprint 6

|[[TD6]]TD6
|Low
|Audit log query performance degrades with large datasets
|Implement log partitioning; add time-based indexes; consider moving to time-series database
|Phase 2

|[[TD7]]TD7
|Medium
|Mobile app stores JWT access token in secure storage instead of memory
|Refactor mobile auth to use memory-only storage with background refresh
|Sprint 4

|[[TD8]]TD8
|Low
|API documentation not automatically generated from code annotations
|Integrate Swagger/OpenAPI generation from NestJS decorators; publish to developer portal
|Sprint 3

|[[TD9]]TD9
|Medium
|No automated backup verification for encrypted private keys
|Implement automated backup restore testing; verify key decryption from backups monthly
|Sprint 5

|[[TD10]]TD10
|Low
|Frontend components not fully accessible (WCAG compliance)
|Conduct accessibility audit; implement ARIA labels; keyboard navigation support
|Phase 2

== Technical Debt Tracking

=== Prioritization Criteria

* **Severity**: Impact on security, reliability, or user experience
* **Effort**: Development time required for resolution
* **Risk**: Likelihood of the debt causing issues
* **Business Value**: Benefit from resolution

=== Review Cadence

* **Weekly**: Review new debt items, update status
* **Sprint Planning**: Select debt items for inclusion
* **Monthly**: Technical debt burndown review
* **Quarterly**: Comprehensive debt assessment
