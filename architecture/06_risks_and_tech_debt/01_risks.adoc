[cols="1,1,4,4,2", id=Risks, options="header"]
|===
|ID |Severity |Description |Remediation |Status

|[[RI1]]R1
|High
|Hedera network outage or degradation could prevent token operations (minting, burning, balance queries)
|Implement circuit breaker pattern; queue failed operations for retry; maintain cached balances in database; monitor Hedera network status
|Monitoring in place

|[[RI2]]R2
|High
|Private key compromise could allow unauthorized token operations
|Keys encrypted with AES-256 and stored in KMS; strict access controls; regular security audits; key rotation procedures
|Mitigated

|[[RI3]]R3
|Medium
|Middle DB integration failure could halt daily points calculation
|Implement retry logic; manual trigger capability; alerting for sync failures; fallback to previous day's data if critical
|Monitoring in place

|[[RI4]]R4
|Medium
|Rapid user growth exceeds batch processing capacity
|Horizontal scaling of worker pods; chunked processing; performance monitoring; capacity planning reviews
|Planned

|[[RI5]]R5
|Medium
|Database discrepancy between application DB and on-chain token balances
|Daily reconciliation job; automated alerts for discrepancies; manual review process; audit logging
|Implemented

|[[RI6]]R6
|Low
|Users lose access to accounts and cannot recover
|Standard password reset flow; admin-assisted account recovery; no user-held keys to lose (custodial model)
|Mitigated by design

|[[RI7]]R7
|Medium
|HBAR price volatility affects operational costs
|Budget buffer for fee fluctuations; batch operations to minimize transactions; monitor daily costs; alert on budget threshold
|Monitoring in place

|[[RI8]]R8
|High
|Data breach exposing user personal information or encrypted keys
|Encryption at rest and in transit; WAF and DDoS protection; incident response plan; regular penetration testing
|Security measures active

|[[RI9]]R9
|Medium
|Regulatory changes affecting blockchain token operations in Tunisia
|Monitor regulatory landscape; design for flexibility; maintain compliance documentation; legal review of operations
|Under monitoring

|[[RI10]]R10
|Low
|Third-party dependency vulnerabilities (npm packages, SDKs)
|Automated vulnerability scanning (Snyk); regular dependency updates; security-focused code reviews
|CI/CD integrated
