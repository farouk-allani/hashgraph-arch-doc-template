= ADR 002: Use NestJS as Backend Framework

*Status*: Accepted

*Date*: December 2025

*Context*:
The backend service needs to handle:

* RESTful API endpoints for web and mobile clients
* Scheduled batch jobs for daily data processing
* Integration with Hedera SDK (JavaScript/TypeScript)
* Integration with PostgreSQL and Redis
* Secure authentication and authorization
* Scalable architecture for growing user base

Alternative frameworks considered:

1. **Express.js**: Minimal, flexible Node.js framework
2. **Fastify**: High-performance Node.js framework
3. **NestJS**: Enterprise-grade TypeScript framework
4. **Django (Python)**: Full-featured Python web framework
5. **Spring Boot (Java)**: Enterprise Java framework

*Decision:*
We will use **NestJS** as the backend framework.

Rationale:

* **TypeScript Native**: Strong typing reduces bugs and improves maintainability
* **Modular Architecture**: Built-in module system aligns with our component design
* **Dependency Injection**: Enterprise patterns for testable, maintainable code
* **Ecosystem**: Excellent packages for PostgreSQL (TypeORM), Redis (Bull), JWT
* **Hedera Compatibility**: JavaScript SDK works seamlessly with TypeScript
* **Team Expertise**: Development team has strong TypeScript experience
* **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation and active community

*Consequences*:

Positive:

* Clean, modular codebase with clear separation of concerns
* Strong typing catches errors at compile time
* Easy to write unit and integration tests
* Excellent support for background job processing
* Guards and interceptors simplify authentication/authorization

Negative:

* Steeper learning curve than Express.js
* More boilerplate code for simple endpoints
* Requires TypeScript build step
