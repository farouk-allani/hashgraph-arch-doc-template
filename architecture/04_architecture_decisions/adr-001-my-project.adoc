= ADR 001: Use Hedera Token Service (HTS) for Loyalty Points Tokenization

*Status*: Accepted

*Date*: December 2025

*Context*:
Enda Tamweel requires a loyalty points system that provides:

* Transparent and immutable record of point balances
* Ability to mint and burn tokens based on business rules
* Low transaction costs for frequent operations
* Integration with existing banking systems
* Regulatory compliance for financial operations

Alternative approaches considered:

1. **Traditional Database Only**: Store points in PostgreSQL without blockchain
2. **Ethereum ERC-20 Token**: Deploy custom smart contract on Ethereum
3. **Private Blockchain**: Deploy on Hyperledger or private network
4. **Hedera Token Service (HTS)**: Use Hedera's native tokenization service

*Decision:*
We will use **Hedera Token Service (HTS)** for tokenizing loyalty points.

Rationale:

* **Native Tokenization**: HTS provides built-in token functionality without custom smart contracts
* **Low Fees**: Predictable, low-cost transactions ($0.001 or less per operation)
* **Fast Finality**: 3-5 second consensus time for all transactions
* **Enterprise Grade**: Governed by major enterprises, suitable for financial applications
* **Built-in Controls**: Native support for minting, burning, and admin keys
* **Compliance**: Transaction fees in USD-equivalent, easy for accounting
* **SDK Support**: Official JavaScript SDK integrates well with NestJS backend

*Consequences*:

Positive:

* Transparent, auditable record of all token operations on public ledger
* No smart contract vulnerabilities to manage
* Low operational costs compared to Ethereum
* Fast transaction confirmation for good user experience

Negative:

* Dependency on Hedera network availability
* On-chain data is public (mitigated by not storing PII on-chain)
* Requires HBAR for transaction fees
* Team needs to learn Hedera SDK
